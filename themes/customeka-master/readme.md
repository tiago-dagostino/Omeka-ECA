# Customeka: a Highly Customizable Omeka Theme

## About

This is a very customizable Omeka theme that allows you to change the fonts, colors, and background images that make up your Omeka site or exhibit. In your theme's settings (Admin -> Appearance -> Themes -> Configure), you can set custom values for:

 * Header font and font sizes
 * Header background image
 * Body font and font sizes
 * Body background image
 * Colors 

Since it's based on the Seasons theme, it is reponsive and generally mobile-friendly. 

### Colors

By changing the two main color settings, Color One and Color Two, you can colorize your entire site. Customeka dynamically generates colors for your whole site or exhibit based on these two colors.

### Item File Gallery

By checking "Item File Gallery," you can display your items and collections in a grid, instead of a list. This can allow you to display many more items on your Browse Items page.  

## History
